// Package service_decorators is to simplify your work on building microservices.
// The common functions for the microservices (such as, Circuit break, Rate limit,
// Metric...) have be encapsulated in the reusable components(decorators).
// To build a service is to decorate the core business logic with the common
// decorators, so you can only focus on the core business logic.
